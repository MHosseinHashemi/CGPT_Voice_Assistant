# ChatGPT based Voice Assistant 
This repository contains a voice assistant program that utilizes speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and the ChatGPT language model for interactive conversations.

## Features
* Voice recording: The program can record voice input from the user using PyAudio.
* Speech recognition: Recorded voice can be converted to text using the Google Speech Recognition API.
* ChatGPT integration: The program sends the text to the ChatGPT model for generating a response using the OpenAI API.
* Text-to-speech conversion: The response generated by ChatGPT can be spoken aloud using the pyttsx3 library.
* Key control: The program listens for specific key presses to start and stop voice recording.
* Continuous interaction: The program allows continuous interaction with the voice assistant until the user decides to stop.
## Requirements
To run the program, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

* keyboard
* pyaudio
* wave
* speech_recognition
* requests
* pyttsx3
* openai
Additionally, you need to obtain an OpenAI API token and set it as the API_TOKEN variable in the program.

## Usage
1. Install the required dependencies mentioned above.
2. Obtain an OpenAI API token and set it as the API_TOKEN variable in the program.
3. Run the program.
4. Press the designated key (default is "space") to start voice recording.
5. Speak into the microphone to provide input.
6. Press the designated key (default is "esc") to stop voice recording.
7. The program will convert the recorded voice to text, send it to ChatGPT for processing, and speak the generated response aloud.
8. The program will continue to listen for key presses to initiate new interactions until the "esc" key is pressed to exit.
